**Gamejam Theme: Escape**
The game is about the 9 rings of hell, and a lost soul's ability to escape to limbo.
There is only one level available, "Treachery", which, in our source material (Dante's Inferno) is described as a cold, icy wasteland. The game features a rotating main area, to represent the ring that needs to be traversed. There is a demon that can float through the ring to attack the soul as well.

To succeed, the soul needs to get through the maze on each ring, avoiding enemies and traps, and venture through the portal at the end of each maze. This will take them to the next level up, until they escape into limbo.
